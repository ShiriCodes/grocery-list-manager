# Grocery List Manager

**Python Project for Learning & Practice**

This Python program allows users to manage a grocery list via a text-based menu interface.  
It was created as part of my personal Python projects to practice working with functions, loops, input validation, and list manipulation.

## Features
- Print the current list of grocery items
- Count the number of items in the list
- Check if a specific item exists
- Count occurrences of a specific item
- Add or remove items from the list
- Identify invalid items (less than 3 characters or containing non-letter characters)
- Remove duplicates
- Exit the program

## Usage
1. Run the script using Python 3:
```bash
python grocery_manager.py
````

2. Enter your grocery items as a single comma-separated string, e.g.:

```
Milk,Cottage,Tomatoes
```

3. Use the menu options by typing numbers (1-9) to perform actions on your list.

## Learning Goals

* Practice writing modular and reusable code
* Implement input validation and error handling
* Manipulate lists and strings
* Build interactive console applications
